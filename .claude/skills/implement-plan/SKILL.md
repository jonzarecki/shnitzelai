# Implement Plan Skill

Execute the next task from TASKS.md following project conventions.

## Trigger
Invoke via `/plan` command or when asked to implement the next task.

## Process
1. Read `TASKS.md` — find the first unchecked item (`- [ ]`)
2. Read `SPEC.md` for product requirements relevant to the task
3. Read `ARCH.md` for architectural constraints, patterns, and file tree
4. Read `.context/activeContext.md` for current session context
5. Implement the task following repo conventions
6. Write tests alongside implementation (TDD when possible)
7. Run tests scoped to the affected module
8. Mark the task done in `TASKS.md` (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`)
9. Update `.context/progress.md` with what was completed
10. Update `.context/activeContext.md` if focus has shifted

## Constraints
- Strict typing — no `any`
- Every module must have corresponding tests
- Update `.context/progress.md` after completing tasks
- Reference `SPEC.md` for product requirements
